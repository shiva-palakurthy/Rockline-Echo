🧠 How Mood Simulation Works
Due to browser limitations, all moods use the same base voice.
Real emotional or gender-based voices are not available natively.
To simulate moods, Rockline Echo modifies:
Pitch (voice height)
Rate (speech speed)
Speech patterns (pauses, prefixes, emphasis)
This creates a perceived emotional difference while remaining fully offline and browser-only.
🎭 Mood Techniques
Mood
Technique
Funny
High pitch, fast rate, playful intro
Sad
Low pitch, slow rate
Robot
Very low pitch, steady rate, pauses
Excited
Very high pitch, fast rate
⚠️ Browser Limitations
Same voice for all moods
No real male/female switching
No true emotional voice acting
For advanced voices, external APIs like Google TTS, Azure Speech, or ElevenLabs are required.
